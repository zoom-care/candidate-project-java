Inital Solution:

I have exposed three endpoints at the following locations.

URL for the top level employees, "CEO" and the nested list of direct reports.

http://localhost:8080/toplevelemployees

URL for a specified employee:

http://localhost:8080/employees?employeeId=1

Default URL with a web form to specify an employee Id.

http://localhost:8080/

All endpoints return a Json representation of the data set requested.
