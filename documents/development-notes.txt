Development notes:

This challenge was solved by creating two GET API calls: 

This will be returning all top employee
   {host}/employee
This will be returning a specific employee by providing the id into the url
   {host}/employee/{id}
Please see on /documents folder, I did include a PostMan Collection with API calls examples
File: Zoom-care.postman_collection.json

Notes: I did face some issues with browser cache data, in order to perform further test I did add some extra test data on /src/main/db/migration/ V2__initial_data_structures.sql
